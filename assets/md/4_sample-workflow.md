# Some Scripts I have written

The following scripts are great examples of starter code. These will take the data through some processing steps that will produce a rough outline of a stacked seismic line.

## [workflow.sh](/file/path/here)

- Takes a file converted from SEGY to SU format.
- Applies AGC, ramping, filters, automatic-deconvolution, Velocities, Statics and Migration all in one workflow.
- Editing the workflow is easy, change variables and functions as needed.
